How we can exchange data/ data transfer between threads- if i have a piece of data whether it is primitive or non pirmtiive hwo can i transfer that piece of data from that one thread to another 

1. Creating 2 threads 
2. If I have a piece of data in Thread 1, how can i transfer it to Thread 2 - Using Static variables - Using non static variables 
- Are you transfering that data by value or reference (what is the implication of that in multi thread programming?) 
- Some approaches may work in Standalone classes and may not work in anonymous classes and vice versa
